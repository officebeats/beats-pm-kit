## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/officebeats/beats-pm-kit
cd beats-pm-kit
chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
```

That's it. The installer creates your folder structure, detects your AI runtime, fixes symlinks, and runs a health check. Takes ~10 seconds.

> **Requires:** Python 3.8+ (pre-installed on macOS/most Linux). No `pip install`, no `npm`, no Docker.

---

### 2. Launch Your Runtime

Open the `beats-pm-kit` folder in any of these AI coding tools. **All are CLIs unless noted.**

| Runtime | Launch Command | Capabilities |
|:--------|:---------------|:-------------|
| **[Google Antigravity](https://antigravity.google/)** (Desktop IDE) | Open folder in Antigravity | ⭐ Primary — parallel fan-out, MCP tools, browser agent |
| **[Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)** (CLI) | `gemini` | File access, web search, tool use |
| **[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview)** (CLI) | `claude` | File access, subagents, tool use |
| **[OpenAI Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex)** (CLI) | `codex` | File access, code execution |
| **[KiloCode](https://kilocode.ai/)** (CLI) | `kilo` | File access, tool use |

> **Which should I use?** If you have Antigravity, use it — the kit was designed for its parallel execution. Otherwise, any CLI above works. The kit auto-adapts via adapter folders (`.gemini/`, `.claude/`, etc.).
> **Codex note:** Codex uses `AGENTS.md` as the primary adapter, `CODEX_COMMANDS.md` for explicit slash-command routing, and generated `.codex/` scaffolding for runtime notes. See [system/docs/codex.md](system/docs/codex.md).

---

### 3. First-Time Setup (The `/start` Wizard)

On your **first session**, the kit auto-detects it's a fresh install and walks you through a 2-minute setup:

```
You open your CLI → Kit detects no .initialized file → Runs /start automatically
```

The wizard asks 3 questions:
1. **Your name** — for task ownership and doc headers
2. **Your manager** — seeds the Boss Protocol for 1:1 prep
3. **Your product focus** — configures your strategic context

Then it shows you the **6 core commands** and you're ready to go.

> **Skip the wizard?** Type `/help` instead to jump straight to the command reference.
> **Re-run it later?** Type `/start` anytime.

---

## 🌪️ Why Product Managers Need This

**Product Management is broken.**
Your day is fragmented across Slack threads, Zoom transcripts, Jira tickets, and stakeholder emails. Context is constantly lost.

This kit is an **Agentic Operating System** built specifically for Product Managers. It leverages **Google Antigravity's** parallel agent execution to parse chaos into strategy.

- **The Black Hole Inbox:** Copy anything to your clipboard. Type `/paste`. Watch the AI extract tasks/bugs and route them to the proper tracker.
- **The Meeting Synthesizer:** Type `/meet`. The AI reads your transcripts, extracts action items, and generates structured notes.
- **The "Boss Protocol":** Type `/boss`. The system cross-references your active tasks with your boss's recent requests, flags stale workstreams, and drafts your 1:1 talking points.

### 🔒 100% Local. Enterprise-Grade Privacy.

| Your Data           | Where It Lives                   | Cloud Access |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------- | :----------- |
| Company strategy    | `1. Company/` on YOUR machine  | ❌ Never     |
| PRDs & specs        | `2. Products/` on YOUR machine | ❌ Never     |
| Meeting transcripts | `3. Meetings/` on YOUR machine | ❌ Never     |
| Task trackers       | `5. Trackers/` on YOUR machine | ❌ Never     |

**No cloud sync. No telemetry. No API calls with your trade secrets.**
Folders 1-5 are `.gitignored` by default. Your private data stays on your machine.

## 🧬 Inside the Engine: Three-Tier Architecture

### 🤖 1. The Virtual PM Team (20 Persona Agents)

The _Identity_ layer. Who is doing the work?

### 🎯 2. The Core Playbooks (26 Protected Workflows)

The _Routing_ layer. Lean slash commands that trigger complex operations. All 26 are **protected core**.

> **💡 Natural Conversation vs Commands:** You are **not required** to use slash commands. If you just talk to the AI naturally (e.g., "Summarize this meeting" or "Help me plan my day"), the system will organically load the correct Agents and Skills. The `/commands` are simply explicit playbook shortcuts to guarantee a highly specific logic sequence (like the exact 7 steps of `/meet`). Both methods seamlessly pull from the same `.agent/` architecture.

| Command        | Purpose                                  |
| :------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| `/boss`        | The 1:1 "Managing Up" Prep               |

## 🖥️ Runtime Compatibility

Built on a **single source of truth** (`.agent/`) with adapters for each runtime. **Antigravity is the gold standard.**

| Capability | Antigravity (Desktop IDE) | Gemini (CLI) | Claude Code (CLI) | Codex (CLI) | KiloCode (CLI) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Parallel Fan-Out** | ✅ Native | ❌ Sequential | ❌ Sequential | ❌ Sequential | ❌ Sequential |
| **Agent Personas (12)** | ✅ Full mesh | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Skills (46)** | ✅ JIT load | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Slash Commands (18)** | ✅ `/command` | ✅ `#command` | ✅ `/command` | ✅ `/command` | ✅ `/command` |
| **Clipboard Ingest** | ✅ Native | ⚠️ Script | ⚠️ Script | ⚠️ Script | ⚠️ Script |
| **Context Guard** | ✅ Auto | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Speed** | ⚡ Fastest | 🟡 Good | 🟡 Good | 🟡 Good | 🟡 Good |

> **Parallel Fan-Out:** When you run `/fan-out`, Antigravity dispatches multiple specialist agents simultaneously. Other runtimes process agents sequentially, making complex workflows 3-5x slower.
> **Codex Operating Model:** Use `AGENTS.md` for the inventory, then load `.agent/workflows/<command>.md` and only the required `SKILL.md` files for the task.

## 🔧 System Rules

The kit operates on a single rule file that governs all agent behavior:

| Rule File | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`GEMINI.md`** | The system constitution — startup sequence, Context Guard (auto-fires every request), agent/skill loading protocol, privacy directives, architecture overview |

### Context Guard (Auto-Fires Every Request)

Built directly into `GEMINI.md`, these rules reduce token waste without any manual intervention:

1. **Parallel-first** — Batch independent tool calls
2. **No re-reads** — Never re-read files already viewed in session
3. **Compact responses** — Skip preamble, lead with the answer
4. **3-skill ceiling** — Max 3 skill assets per request
5. **Conversation decay** — Auto-manages context after 15+ exchanges to keep sessions fast

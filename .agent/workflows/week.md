# /week - Weekly Tactical Plan

**Trigger**: User types `/week`.

> **🗓️ Key Checkpoint**: Boss 1:1 is **every Friday around lunch**. The weekly plan should always anchor around this meeting. Boss Asks should be resolved *before* Friday.

## Steps

1.  **Parallel Context Mining**:
    - **Action**: In a SINGLE turn, read `5. Trackers/TASK_MASTER.md` AND `5. Trackers/critical/boss-requests.md`.
    - **Deadlines**: Scan for dates in the next 14 days.
    - **Calendar**: Ask user "Any key meetings this week?" (Interactive).

2.  **Synthesis (Staff PM)**:
    - Group items into **This Week** (Must Do) and **Next Week** (Tee Up).
    - Highlight **Risks**: Items due soon but not started.
    - Highlight **Boss Wins**: Items that satisfy boss requests.

3.  **Output**:
    - Create/Update `5. Trackers/WEEKLY_PLAN.md`.
    - Format:

      ```markdown

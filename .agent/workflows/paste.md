# /paste - Clipboard Capture & Triage

**Trigger**: User types `/paste` to capture whatever is on their clipboard.

> **Value Prop**: One command to capture Slack messages, screenshots, emails, or files directly from the clipboard, classify them, and route to the correct tracker.

## Steps

// turbo

1.  **Execute Clipboard Bridge**:
    - Run: `python system/scripts/clipboard_bridge.py`
    - Script auto-detects content type (text, image, or files).

2.  **Execute File Organizer (The Concierge)**:
    - Run: `python system/scripts/file_organizer.py`
    - Scans `0. Incoming/` for new files.
    - Prompts user for intent: "Task Source? Reference? Spec?"
    - Moves processed files to `0. Incoming/processed/`.

3.  **Content Detection Priority**:
    - **Files** (copied from file manager) → Saved to `0. Incoming/staging/`
    - **Image** (screenshot to clipboard) → Saved to `0. Incoming/staging/`
    - **Text** (copied text) → Saved to `0. Incoming/raw/`

4.  **Classification** (via `inbox-processor` skill):
    - **Bug** (error, crash, broken) → Route to `bugs-master.md`
    - **Boss Ask** (VIP speaker, urgent, ASAP) → Route to `boss-requests.md`
    - **Task** (TODO, action item, deadline) → Route to `TASK_MASTER.md`
    - **Decision** (decided, agreed, go/no-go) → Route to `DECISION_LOG.md`
    - **FYI** (heads up, no action) → Keep in `0. Incoming/fyi/`
    - **Unclear** → Route to `BRAIN_DUMP.md` (Parking Lot)

5.  **Entity Tagging**:
    - Tag with `[Company A]`, `[Company B]`, or ask if unclear.

6.  **Output**:
    - Confirmation table of what was captured and where it was routed.

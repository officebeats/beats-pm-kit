# Using Beats PM Brain with Notion

> Step-by-step guide for Notion users

## Two Ways to Use This

### Option A: Notion as Your Viewer (Recommended Hybrid)

Keep the markdown files as your source of truth, sync to Notion for pretty viewing

### Option B: Notion Native

Import the structure into Notion and adapt the workflow

---

## Option A: Hybrid Setup (Markdown + Notion Sync)

### Step 1: Set Up Your PM Brain Folder

Download this repository to a synced folder (Dropbox, iCloud, OneDrive, Google Drive)

### Step 2: Use Antigravity/Claude for AI Processing

The AI agents work best with direct file access. Use:

- Antigravity (recommended)
- Claude Code
- Cursor

### Step 3: Sync Key Files to Notion

Use a tool like **Notion Markdown Importer** or manually copy key outputs:

| What to Sync        | How Often       |
| ------------------- | --------------- |
| Morning/EOD Briefs  | Daily           |
| Weekly Summary      | Weekly          |
| Critical Items      | As needed       |
| Stakeholder Updates | Before meetings |

### Step 4: Create a Notion Dashboard

Build a dashboard in Notion that links to your synced content

## Option B: Notion Native Setup

### Step 1: Create the Folder Structure

Create these pages/databases in Notion:

```
🧠 PM Brain
├── ⚙️ Settings
├── 📥 Inbox (Database)
├── 🔥 Critical
│   ├── Boss Requests (Database)
│   └── Escalations (Database)

├── 🎯 Strategy
│   ├── Opportunities (Database)
│   └── Decisions (Database)
├── 📅 Meetings
│   └── Briefs (Database)
└── 🤖 Agents (Page with agent prompts)
```

### Step 2: Copy Agent Prompts

Create a page called "Agents" and paste the contents of each file from `system/agents/`

### Step 3: Use with Notion AI

1. Open an agent prompt page
2. Select all the text
3. Use Notion AI: "Use this as instructions and..."
4. Give your command

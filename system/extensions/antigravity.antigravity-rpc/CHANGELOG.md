# Changelog

All notable changes to the Antigravity Discord RPC extension will be documented in this file.

## [0.0.14] - 2026-02-21

### Fixed
- Fixed Discord Rich Presence persisting after closing Antigravity — extension now clears activity before destroying the RPC client on deactivation
- Fixed stale agent status lingering for up to 5 minutes after the agent goes idle — active conversation is now re-checked on every poll cycle (~3.33s) instead of only on file change events

### Changed
- README: corrected manual installation command from `code` to `antigravity`
- README: corrected "How It Works" description to accurately reflect that task name uses the nearest `##` section heading, falling back to the `#` main heading

## [0.0.13] - 2025-12-06

### Fixed
- Included CHANGELOG.md in the package (previously missing in 0.0.12)

## [0.0.12] - 2025-12-06

### Fixed
- General stability improvements and version verification
- CRITICAL: Fixed hardcoded user path. Now dynamically resolves the user's home directory using `os.homedir()`
- Extension now works correctly for all users, not just the developer

## [0.0.11] - 2025-11-22

### Changed
- **Internal**: Migrated codebase from JavaScript to TypeScript for better stability and type safety.
- Preserved all existing functionality including the critical path fix and smart header parsing.

## [0.0.10] - 2025-11-22

### Fixed
- CRITICAL: Fixed hardcoded user path. Now dynamically resolves the user's home directory using `os.homedir()`.
- Extension now works correctly for all users, not just the developer.

## [0.0.9] - 2025-11-22

### Changed
- Adjusted conversation polling interval from 2s to 3.33s to optimize performance

## [0.0.8] - 2025-11-22

### Changed
- Improved status accuracy: now uses the nearest `## Section Header` for the task name instead of the file title
- This ensures the status updates as you move through different sections of a task, even if the main title isn't updated

## [0.0.7] - 2025-11-21

### Fixed
- Fixed issue where status would get "locked" to an old task indefinitely
- Added 5-minute timeout: status now reverts to "Idle" if agent hasn't been active recently

### Added
- Gallery banner with Antigravity-themed dark colors
- Explicit note in README that this is Antigravity-specific
